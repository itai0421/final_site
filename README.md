<p>&nbsp;The iOS is to the iPhone what Windows is to PCs or macOS is to Macs.</p>
<p>Apple's mobile operating system iOS runs the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch devices. Originally known as the iPhone OS, the name was changed with the introduction of the iPad.</p>
<p>It uses a multi-touch interface in which simple gestures operate the device, such as swiping your finger across the screen to move to the next page or pinching your fingers to zoom out.</p>
<p>There are more than 2 million iOS apps available for download in the Apple App Store, the most popular app store of any mobile device.</p>
<p>Unveiled in 2007 for the&nbsp;first-generation iPhone, iOS has since been extended to support other Apple devices such as the&nbsp;iPod Touch&nbsp;(September 2007) and the&nbsp;iPad&nbsp;(January 2010).</p>
<p>As of March&nbsp;2018, Apple's&nbsp;App Store&nbsp;contains more than 2.1&nbsp;million iOS applications, 1&nbsp;million of which are native for iPads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;These&nbsp;mobile apps&nbsp;have collectively been downloaded more than 130&nbsp;billion times. Major versions of iOS are released annually.</p>
<p>The current stable version,&nbsp;iOS 14, was released to the public on September 16, 2020.</p>
<p>It brought many user interface changes, including the ability to place widgets on the home screen, a compact UI for both Siri and phone calls, and the ability to change both the default web browser and email apps.</p>
<p>Now No devices were dropped, as all devices supported by&nbsp;iOS 13&nbsp;are able to run&nbsp;iOS 14.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How Much Does iOS Cost? How Often Is It Updated?</strong> </span></p>
<p>Apple does not charge for updates to the operating system.</p>
<p>Apple also gives away two suites of software products with the purchase of iOS devices: The&nbsp;iWork suite of office apps&nbsp;&mdash; which includes a word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation software &mdash; and the iLife suite, which includes video-editing software, music-editing and creation software, and photo-editing software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple apps&nbsp;like Safari, Mail, and Notes ship with the operating system by default.&nbsp; Apple&nbsp;releases a major update to iOS&nbsp;once a year&nbsp;with an announcement at Apple's developer conference in early summer.</p>
<p>It is followed by a release in early fall that is timed to coincide with the announcement of the most recent iPhone and iPad models.</p>
<p>These free releases add major features to the operating system. Apple also issues bug fix releases and security patches throughout the year.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to Update Your Device to the Newest Version of iOS?</strong></span></p>
<p>The easiest way to update your iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch is to use the scheduling feature.</p>
<p>When a new update is released, the device asks if you want to update it at night.</p>
<p>Simply tap Install Later on the dialog box and remember to plug in your device before you go to bed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also install the update manually by going into the device's settings, selecting General from the left-side menu and then selecting Software Update.</p>
<p>This menu takes you to a screen where you can download the update and install it on the device. The only requirement is that your device must have enough storage space to complete the process.</p>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Market share</strong></span>
<p>iOS is the second most popular mobile operating system in the world, after&nbsp;Android.</p>
<p>Sales of iPads in recent years are also behind Android, while, by web use (a proxy for all use), iPads (using iOS) are still the most popular.</p>
<p>By the middle of 2012, there were 410&nbsp;million devices activated.</p>
<p>At&nbsp;WWDC&nbsp;2014,&nbsp;Tim Cook&nbsp;said 800&nbsp;million devices had been sold by June 2014.</p>
<p>During Apple's quarterly earnings call in January 2015, the company announced that they had sold over one billion iOS devices since 2007.</p>
<p>By late 2011, iOS accounted for 60% of the market share for smartphones and tablets.</p>
<p>By the end of 2014, iOS accounted for 14.8% of the smartphone market&nbsp;and 27.6% of the tablet and two-in-one market.</p>
<p>In February 2015,&nbsp;Stat Counter&nbsp;reported iOS was used on 23.18% of smartphones and 66.25% of tablets worldwide, measured by internet usage instead of sales.</p>
<p>In the third quarter of 2015, research from Strategy Analytics showed that iOS adoption of the worldwide smartphone market was at a record low 12.1%, attributed to lackluster performance in China and Africa.</p>
<p>Android accounted for 87.5% of the market, with Windows Phone and BlackBerry accounting for the rest.</p>
